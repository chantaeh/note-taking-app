## Steps
- Create a new repo under your username and add it as a new remote to the project: `git remote add personal <github-address>`
- Push your changes to your personal repo as well: `git push personal main`
- Use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy your application and drop the link to your website in the [NETLIFY-ADDRESS](./NETLIFY-ADDRESS.md) file

## Bonus points
- Tags. They need to be searchable. That is, when a user is picking a tag for a note, the application should suggest similar tags
- Sorting and searching for the notes
